# MPLSSL2021
This is a stats website for a casual soccer league I partcipate in called MPLSSL.

## The website is hosted by Heroku [here](https://mplssl2021.herokuapp.com/).

The website is run on a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) server. 
Up to date data is pulled from the league manager's spreadsheet using Node.js and the [Google Sheets API](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api).
Scoring Leaders are visualized using the [ApexCharts](https://apexcharts.com/) library for javascript.
